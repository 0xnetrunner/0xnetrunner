Hey there 👋🏻,

I am netrunner  a semi-retired software engineer. 

I am passionate about decentralization, transparency and public goods.

From the code to the values, I am Ethereum-aligned and support projects that align with these values.

I believe Ethereum has the potential to solve some of humanity’s most crucial coordination issues and I am committed to building a better world.
