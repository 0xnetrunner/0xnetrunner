Hey there 👋🏻,

I am netrunner (aka netrunner.eth / 0xnetrunner),  a semi-retired software engineer. 

I am interested in everything blockchain having read Satoshi's whitepaper back in '09 and got seriously into it in '12.

Coming from a darker place on the internet, I take OpSec seriously so that's all I'll reveal for now.
